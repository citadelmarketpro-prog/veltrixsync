                    An Affiliate can be either an Individual user or a corporation that participates in
                    VeltrixSync&apos;s Affiliate Program, promoting VeltrixSync&apos;s service. Affiliates register
                    for the program and then they are given a unique and personalised URL, which they use
                    to advertise and promote VeltrixSync. By promoting VeltrixSync, Affiliates introduce
                    Referral Clients (new users) to VeltrixSync&apos;s services.

                  <BodyText>
                    Affiliates receive a commission for their service for accounts that sign up through the
                    Affiliate&apos;s referral link (URL). Kindly note that only one affiliate account is permitted
                    per individual unless a written permission is granted from the affiliate department.

                  <BodyText>
                    To endorse Affiliates&apos; efforts, VeltrixSync provides its Affiliates with resources,
                    guidelines, support, and a variety of promotional tools, such as banners. Additionally,
                    it provides widgets (dynamic and non-dynamic ones) which can be easily integrated into
                    personal website pages, in order to enhance Affiliates&apos; advertising strategies.

                    The Affiliate Program offers a lucrative opportunity to supplement monthly earnings.
                    VeltrixSync&apos;s Program is flexible; therefore depending on the time and effort Affiliates
                    are willing to commit, they can enjoy equivalent earnings.

                <BodyText>
                  Suspension of an Affiliate account may occur as a result of the following instances:
                </BodyText>

                <BulletList
                  items={[
                    "Account Inactivity - an Affiliate account is considered inactive if there has been no successful login into the account for a period of more than 6 months.",
                    "Failure to specifically acknowledge or abide by formal notifications made to the Affiliate by either email or telephone, during which VeltrixSync has made every reasonable effort to inform the Affiliate that they are engaging in conduct/ actions that directly or indirectly violates either the Affiliates Program codes or existing Regulatory codes.",
                    "Affiliates who perform inappropriate behaviour, for example solicitation of customers in an unethical or illegal manner; such instances will be examined on a case-by-case basis.",
                    `Failure to abide by all of the advertisement guidelines as stated in Section "Advertising and Promotional Guidelines", may lead to the suspension of one's Affiliate account solely at VeltrixSync's discretion.`,
                  ]}
                />

                <BodyText>
                  The list is not exhaustive – in addition to the account suspension, other penalties
                  may also apply, such as rejection of the outstanding revenues or pending payments as
                  well as removal of the Affiliate&apos;s Referral accounts prior to the account
                  suspension.
                </BodyText>

                <BodyText>
                  Suspension of an Affiliate account may lead to permanent banning from use of the
                  Affiliates service – in other words, termination of the Affiliate&apos;s account.
                  Liability for any consequences resulting from an Affiliate&apos;s account being either
                  suspended or terminated is the sole burden of the Affiliate account holder.
