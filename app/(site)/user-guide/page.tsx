                  You may also amend the default Stop and Limit, and it is possible to set a Trailing

                  start trailing immediately as soon as the trade is opened. For example, a BUY
                  EUR/USD trade is set with -30 pips Trailing Stop and opened at 1.383. The trade is
                  opened with a Stop of -30 pips (at 1.380), and if it starts winning even by one pip,
                  the Trailing Stop will be updated accordingly. So when the trade reaches a High of 5
                  pips (rate 1.3835), the Stop will be updated 30 pips away from this new rate, at
                  1.3805 (-25 pips away from the trade&apos;s opening price). After a Trailing Stop is set,
                  it is updated automatically as described above without the need to remain logged in
                  the account.
