                    VeltrixSync carries out regular internal review of the measures and procedures
                    applied to ensure that they remain appropriate, effective, comprehensive and
                    proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of its business activities,
                    especially in terms of the nature and the range of the investment services and
                    activities it undertakes, and that appropriate measures for the correction of any
                    deficiencies will be taken without undue delay.

                    In addition to all the above measures, VeltrixSync has an internal audit function
                    and a compliance function which are in charge of controlling the application of
                    VeltrixSync&apos;s legal and/or regulatory obligations and internal procedures,
                    including the above measures and the satisfaction of the requirement to avoid
                    situations of conflicts of interest.
